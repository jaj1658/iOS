**********Description**********
Repository of iOS projects:
1) ***Store_Lab*** - Used Object Oriented Programming using Objective-C to program an imaginary store's inventory and functions, updating the store's stock of items based on which ones were bought and not bought. 
2) ***alienESPGame*** - An iOS game application that asks the user to pick a card in a standard deck of 52 cards, and uses UITabBarControllers in order to give the user hints as to what the computer's chosen card is, or to reveal the card to them altogether. UI designed using XCode's StoryBoard and UX programmed using Objective-C.
3) ***SpaceshipStore*** - The iOS application of an imaginary spaceship store. It shows the store's initial inventory, and allows the user to add their own spaceships. The application also shows the user how many items were added, and how many total items are in the inventory after each update. UI designed using XCode's StoryBoard and UX programmed using Objective-C.
